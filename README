 Description
 -----------
  This program continuously reads or write data from/to a block device. Using
  a pre-defined block size for the I/O operations, it reports the latency for
  completing the requests (in microseconds).

  The reports are printed roughly at every second in the following format:
  1394101734: 110 us (981663/8890)

  Where:
    1394101734  is the unix time since epoch
    110 us      is the latency for reading/writing that particular block size
    (ttt/nnn)   is the latency expressed as number of operations (nnn) that
                completed in (ttt) microseconds

  Alternatively, the "-s" command line option can be used for a simplified
  report that includes only the latency, without unit or other information.

  All I/O operations are synchronous read() or write() system calls executed
  on page-aligned pre-allocated buffers. The block device is opened with the
  O_DIRECT flag. Apart from block devices, this program might work on pre-
  allocated files. It will try to work out the size of the file and operate
  on that range.


 Compiling
 ---------
  gcc -o latency latency.c -Wall -O3 -s


 Usage
 -----
  Usage: ./latency [ -hsw ] [ -b size ] dev_name [ iterations ]
         -h               Print help message and quit.
         -s               Simple output: print latency only.
         -w               Write instead of read. USE WITH CARE.
         -b size          Use <size> bytes at a time (default=4096).
         dev_name         Specify block device to operate on.
         iterations       Execute for so many iterations and exit.


 Examples
 --------
  ./latency -b 32768 /dev/sdc2
    - This will read 32KiB blocks from /dev/sdc2 and report roughly at
      every second. Once it reaches the end of the device, it will seek
      back to its beginning and continue.

  ./latency -b 16384 /dev/sdd 10
    - This will read 16KiB blocks from /dev/sdd and report roughly at
      every second, ending after 10 iterations (or roughly 10 seconds).
      If, during that time, it reaches the end of the device, it will
      seek back to its beginning and continue.

  ./latency -w -b 4096 /dev/sdb 5
    - This will _write_ 4KiB blocks to /dev/sdb and report roughly at
      every second, ending after 5 iterations (or roughly 5 seconds).
      If, during that time, it reaches the end of the device, it will
      seek back to its beginning and continue.

  ./latency -q -w -b 131072 /dev/sdc1
    - This will _write_ 128KiB blocks to /dev/sdc1 and report roughly at
      every second. Reports will be simplified and include only the latency
      without unit or any other information.
